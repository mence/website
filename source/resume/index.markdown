## Currently Experimenting With/Learning##

* Objective-C and iOS 7 development (I've been playing around with Swift and it's definitely interesting but I'm not sure it's ready for large-scale applications and interoptability with Objective-C libraries.)
* [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) - May 2014: Our [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) app using this test suite has just gone live in Production. I'm planning on writing up my thoughts on the combination of [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) + [Mocha](https://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) + [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for a fast feedback development environment with a well groomed test pyramid.
* Extending my experience with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) product development - especially development for monitoring devices such as [Pebble](http://getpebble.com/), [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/)
* Ambient awareness - build monitors such as [blink(1)](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thingm/blink1-the-usb-rgb-led), [build dashboards](https://github.com/intentmedia/dashboard.js) and [L8 SmartLight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/l8smartlight/l8-smartlight-the-soundless-speaker)

Congrats, you can haz source code.

The skinny on this website is that it's Markdown rendered by Jekyll. Well, Jekyll in the Octopress flavour.

Anyway, if you're really this keen to be reading my source code, we should probably have a chat about working together. We'd probably be friends. You should definitely mention that you read this!

Cheers mate (that's Australian for thanks)!
