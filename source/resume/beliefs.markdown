### I believe in:

* **Product simplicity**: *simple and minimal apps win every thing*
* Shipping the **right stuff**: *know what you're shipping, for whom and why*
* That **a MVP isn't minimal for your users**: *ship the minimal useful viable product*
* **Continuous delivery** over timed releases: *get faster incrementally*
* **Small products** over monolithic apps: *bigger doesn't always mean better*
* **Test automation** over manual QA: *let the computers do their thing*
* **Production like testing** over fake test data: *Test like it's the real thing*
* **Exploratory testing** supplements automation: *let the testers outside the box*
* **Small passionate multidisciplinary teams** over hiring exactly for that role
* **Good people** over experience: *working with the right people is better than working with experience*
* **A complete effort in production** over half-assed hack: *Hacks are prototypes to provide ideas*
* **Slow is smooth, smooth is fast**: *a team needs to get it right before they can go fast*
* **Experience in teams** over experience in code: *it's better to hire for fit than tenure*
* **Only working on master** over feature branches: *feature branches are more pain than they are worth*
* **[Languages that your developers work on their spare time](http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html)** over enterprise languages: *because Java should die already*
* **Open discussion** over tracking tools: collaborating through [discussions and meetings](http://timhordern.com/agile-meetings/) is more valuable than a tracking tool
* **Diversity** over recruiting by pattern matching: *highly diverse teams work better than the status-quo teams*

### I don't believe in

* Manual QA: if you are just getting a QA to rubber stamp someone else's work, what's the point?
* Waterfall: Big bang is all risk, no reward
