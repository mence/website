I got to hear [Marty Cagan](https://twitter.com/cagan) speak at
[Etsy's Code as Craft](http://codeascraft.com/) series in Brooklyn last week.
[It was a great talk](http://codeascraft.com/speakers/marty-cagan-continuous-innovation/), covering
all aspects of building innovative products and a great product-focused culture (something I care
about a lot, and unfortunately don't get much of a chance to practice). The talk is available for
streaming here:

Marty Cagan is the Founder of the Silicon Valley Product Group, where he gets to work with many of
the leading technology teams in the world. Prior to this, Marty was the original SVP of Product and
Design for eBay. He began his career working for 10 years as a software developer at HP Labs, and
then moved on to join a young Netscape Communications as their VP Platform and Tools (alongside a
few other bright lights, like [Marc Andreessen](http://blog.pmarca.com/) and
[Ben Horowitz](http://www.bhorowitz.com/)). Marty is the author of [INSPIRED: How To Create Products Customers Love](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981690408/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0981690408&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=52NY7WFEMT4YPRWY),
which digs deeper into the ideas he touched on in his talk.

## <a name="highlights"></a> Highlights

Marty's ten observations for building a continuously innovating workplace were:

1.  [Vision and Passion](#vision-and-passion) - define a 2-3 year aspirational product vision of what
    you are trying to achieve
2.  [Know What You Can't Know](#know-what-you-cant-know) - recognise that the standard product
    development approach is crap, that half or more of your ideas won't work, and it'll take 2-4
    iterations to get something that makes money. The Continuous Discovery model helps separate the
    good ideas from the bad ones in a fast, iterative approach.
3.  [Know What Your Customers Can't Know](#know-what-your-customers-cant-know) - accept that people
    don't know what they want until they see it, so asking them directly doesn't always work.
    Instead, use qualitative and quantitative observation to elicit ideas.
4.  [Product Discovery](#product-discovery) - this should be your core competency: getting to
    validated ideas with data showing that they're going to work. You can discover ideas from your
    Engineering team or your customers to then run experiments. These experiments are the start of
    your product.
5.  [Dedicated Teams](#dedicated-teams) - the best companies run dedicated product teams comprising
    Product, UX and Engineers. These are not project teams but stay together for at least 1-2 years.
6.  [Outcome Over Output](#outcome-over-output) - use KPIs and goals to give teams outcomes to work
    towards. Don't measure outputs like lines of code.
7.  [The Role of Design](#the-role-of-design) - Design is hugely important and is more than just the
    look and feel (or UI). Recognise all the different areas and incorporate them.
8.  [True Collaboration](#true-collaboration) - You need Engineers, Designers and Product Managers
    truly collaborating in a colocated space.
9.  [The Need for Speed](#the-need-for-speed) - Measure how long it takes to get an idea through
    the product development cycle and improve your techniques for evaluating ideas.
10. [Product Culture](#product-culture) - A product culture is not a company's culture (and vice
    versa). A product culture respects data over opinions, and represents true collaboration between
    product and engineering.

## <a name="continuous-innovation"></a> Continuous Innovation

Innovation is the purpose of the various types of people in a product organisation:

* Product Management
* UX
* Engineering

Continuous Innovation is about delivering *significant* optimisations, which is about consistently adding
value, more than just incremental changes.

Marty felt that these companies represented great examples of innovative companies:

* [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) - they're innovating across a whole range of transport markets
* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=VAWDFWQ5TZQFMLH2) -
  they've done it dozens of times across any number of industries. They **not** a one & done place.

Ask yourself: If you just kept your existing product going, with no new work or features (even
simpler: if you just kept the site up), would you still grow? If the answer's yes, then you're not
innovating, you're just experiencing organic growth.

### A bit of Marty's background

Marty previously worked as a developer at [HP Labs](http://www.hpl.hp.com/). Here he got to see
a research lab at a great time for HP (it was the age of the desktop, after all). But one
interesting thing he saw was the lab had some critical KPIS, including measuring the % of revenue
from products created in the last 2-3 years of the lab (it had to be at least 50%). After a particularly bad waterfall project, Marty asked himself, "Who decided we should build this product?". He came to the conclusion that other people had made the decision not the technology team. The further realisation
was there's not much point investing effort when you don't know that you're going to succeed.

[{% img right http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0062273205&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=timhor0e-20 %}](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062273205/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062273205&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=2W4LJ2B7RTB6RBME)
Marty then worked at Netscape alongside [Ben Horowitz](http://www.bhorowitz.com/). Marty strongly
recommended to us Ben's new book, [The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062273205/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062273205&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=AG6KGC2KKTU75UCT). They worked together at a
fertile time for Netscape which spawned JavaScript, SSL and a bunch of other technologies. Marty was
then introduced to [Pierre Omidyar](https://twitter.com/pierre), co-founder of eBay. Marty set about
building a product/UX team at eBay, which was his first time building an app, rather than a
platform/infrastructure piece.

As a side note, Marty considers [Etsy](http://etsy.com) as what [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) could
have been!

### So what are the keys to innovation?

Marty had a list of 10 keys to continuous innovation. They're not his prescribed list, just things
that he's observed in top-performing product teams.

## <a name="vision-and-passion"></a> 1. Vision and Passion

Way too many teams just start building. They just start pumping out code. Funnily enough, a lot of
teams in Capital-A Agile start a bunch of sprints cranking out code.

Instead, you should spend some time defining a **product vision**.

A product vision is a 2-3 year aspirational view of what you are trying to achieve. You want to be
painting a picture of where you see things going. This helps recruit talent for your team - those
people join because they find your vision compelling. Our job as product people is to get the team
excited about that vision.

A good example of the power of the vision is [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/). They're a company
built around SEC filings, not exactly the most thrilling thing ever. But they have actually
fundamentally changed the lives of their customers, those accountants and business people stuck
doing those filings in big enterprises. That's a powerful vision. They now have a higher
[Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) than Apple!

## <a name="know-what-you-cant-know"></a> 2. Know What You Can't Know

[{% img right http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0307887898&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=timhor0e-20 %}](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=6Y3XI62S3OFH6ZOC)
Most people in the room had read [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=USI53XJ5MPTBGBIT),
and Marty pointed out that the lesson that it teaches us is that *waste is bad*. So let's not waste
things! Blindily building what we fundamentally *can't* know about is just wasteful.

Marty then showed us a diagram he'd drawn of the typical product development process in most
companies:

```
Idea
   `-> "Biz Case"
            `-> Roadmap
                    `-> "Requirements"
                             `-> Design
                                    `-> Build
                                           `-> Test (QA)
                                                   `-> Deploy
```

In this view, once an `Idea` is found, a `Business Case` is used to establish the profit and the
cost of the `Idea`. But the sad thing about most `Business Cases` is that they will actually make
nothing. How can you actually know if the Idea is any good if you haven't deployed anything?

You don't know! You don't know how much it will actually make or how much it will cost. They're just
guesses and assumptions.

In fact, when it comes to costings, a lot of businesses will do finger in the air 'estimation',
where they corner some poor engineer and badger them to get t-shirt size estimates (Small, Medium,
Large, X-Large, etc), which are totally arbitrary and fake.

Then, businesses build a `Roadmap`, which Marty considers the absolute worst thing. Because now that
the organisation has the `Roadmap`, they depend on it to guide their products and call out others
on their performance based on the `Roadmap`. The team then blindly starts a `Requirement` process,
writing user stories, or in even worse places, writing requirement documents. There's a `Design`
phase where some UI work is drawn up based on the stories.

Then finally, they eventually start a `Build` phase. This is where a lot of so-called "Agile" teams
believe they're being Agile, holding several iterations here. Some worse teams even tack on an
iteration for `Test (QA)`, which they call 'Hardening'. Eventually, the `Idea` is `Deployed`. And
now our product validation can finally begin!

However, if we recognise that we don't really know what we're doing, then this process is the
**most** wasteful process ever.

Marty had two key observations to share here:

**1. Half (at least) of your ideas will *never* work with customers.**

* Sometimes the idea is just bad and doesn't work with customers.
* Sometimes your customers *do* want to use the idea but it's hard to understand, so they disregard
  it.
* Sometimes your development has made it hard to use, so they disregard it.

Marty thinks that the best product teams start with the assumption that 75% of their ideas are crap.

**2. For the other half of your ideas that *do* work with customers, it will take 2-4 iterations
before we get to Time to Money.**

In the product development process, Time to Money would be the point where we've got the right,
validated product, and we can sell it, and we're making money. But, if it takes 3 months for a full
iteration from having the idea to deploying it, with 4 iterations required to really get to Time to
Money, that's a *whole year* before you're at the Money stage!

Marty's comment:

> The best teams embrace this.

Marty had an alternative approach to introduce to us, the **Continuous Discovery** model:

```
Ideas
    `-->
          Discovery
      ------------------------>
         |   |   |   |   |
         |   |   |   |   |
         `-> `-> `-> `-> `->
        -------------------------->
            Delivery
```

This process involves Product, Design and Engineering collaborating.

`Discovery` helps us separate the good ideas from the bad ones.

`Delivery` is about building production quality products, involving considerations of test
automation, scalability, globalisation, security, etc.

For `Delivery`, Marty thinks teams should be releasing *at least* every week. Teams should be aiming
to move to the [Continuous Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/delivery.html) model, like Etsy has. In
this model, you should be doing at a minimum 5 iterations a week. You should be aiming for at least
15 iterations a week.

Remember, we can't know until we validate our ideas with customers. The faster we do that, the
better.

## <a name="know-what-your-customers-cant-know"></a> 3. Know What Your Customers Can't Know

In B2B-focused products, the typical customer approach is that you have a bunch of sales
organisations who go away and sell your product. They come back with a cheque for a sale and a
laundry list of features.

In Consumer-focused products, your problem *isn't* your customers, it's that those feature ideas are
filtered through your executives. Your executives don't know what's really possible with the
technology that you have (or that you might potentially have).

Really good stuff is made possible by technology. Engineers know that. Executives often don't.

If you're a Product Owner or a Product Manager, and your role says you should be gathering
requirements, that's the antithesis of Product.

As an aside, Marty remembered how companies used to do product development in NY: they had
Capital-I `Information Technology (IT)` teams, which was a service organisation for the Capital-B
`Business`. Marty also thinks it's a big smell if you start hearing product teams talking about the
`Business`: it means they are no longer thinking about their customers. Thankfully, Marty thinks NYC
startup are currently operating on par with Silicon Valley startups in their product thinking.

Ultimately, Marty believes **none of us know what we want until we see it**. Apple is one of the
few organisations to get this, and consequently built the most prototypes of any organisation that
Marty had ever seen (Marty recognised this could be a consequence of them being a hardware company,
but it's still an interesting note).

So how do you go about finding out what your customers actually want?

When Marty works with a product team, he ramps up the customer iteraction way, *way* up to *at least*
once every week at a minimum. Ideally he's aiming for multiple times a week.

The two main methods of observations are:

* qualitatively: an in-person observation
* quantitatively: a data-based observation

The best teams do *both qualitative and quantitative observation*.

## <a name="product-discovery"></a> 4. Product Discovery

This is the main competency of a product organisation. This is our day job!

The end-goal of this process are validated ideas where you have data that they're going to work.

Marty thinks that the best source of innovation in your company isn't your product manager, it's
your *engineering team*. They see the possibility of the technology every day. They're optimistic
about a technology that solves a problem. They are inspired by ideas from looking at the data.

Other sources of innovation:

* watching our customers struggle with *our* products.
* watching our customers struggle with our *competitors* products.

Referring back to [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=USI53XJ5MPTBGBIT),
Marty reiterated something [I've talked about before](http://www.timhordern.com/minimally-minimal-minimums):
that the [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is
**not** a `Product`. It's an **experiment**. If you asked your marketing team about what they
thought about your MVP, they'd call it a pile of crap that destroys the brand.

Some better terms to use when referring to these are `MVP tests` or a `MVP experiments`. They aim
to get to the term that [Marc Andreessen](http://blog.pmarca.com/) coined: [Product/Market Fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit).

The MVP experiment here is the *start* of something, not your final product. They're prototypes.
Your actual product is the point when you have something that you can deliver, and that you can sell.

### Prototypes

Marty alluded to 2 main types of Prototypes:

1. **Simulations (User Prototypes)** - a friend of his called this the "fake it before you make it"
   approach
2. **Live Data Prototypes** - 2 examples: connecting to real data sources, or sending real traffic
   to your prototype. This is used when we need real data and real traffic to validate our idea.

Our aim in building a prototype is to **build enough to measure the minimum required to validate our
idea**. Marty's rule of thumb is that your prototype should be somewhere in the range of 20-30% of
the real quality of a production version. You're also aiming to send only a fraction of your traffic
to the prototype.

Marty summarised `Discovery` as: **Find out the good ideas from the bad**.

## <a name="dedicated-teams"></a> 5. Dedicated Teams

Marty told us that the best companies run dedicated product teams. These teams are together
for an extended period (1-2 years) and handle everything to do with that product: new features,
bug fixes, optimizations, everything. In Lean terminology, this is a *durable* product team. The
team needs to comprise Product, UX and Engineers - a truly cross-functional team.

Marty clarified that this is **not** a project team. Project teams don't stay together for long
enough and don't go through enough iterations to truly move between Discovery and Delivery. It's
very much an old-world product development approach to use a project team.

If it's possible, you should colocate the team. At Yahoo, [Marissa Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer)
removed the idea of working remotely or from home (even as she was 8 months pregnant)! Very few
teams were colocated, and a lot of teams had yearly roadmaps to work towards (even worse)!

How do you manage these dedicated teams? Don't give them a yearly roadmap. Give them KPIs and goals,
and let them experiment with ideas to reach those KPIs. This leads us to the notion of
outcome-driven development.

## <a name="outcome-over-output"></a> 6. Outcome over Output

Marty reminded us that in a product-focused organisation, pushing code itself isn't interesting.
Outcomes are very interesting.

As we were sitting in the Etsy Labs, Marty dreamed up a hypothetical scenario that might play out
for a continuously innovating organisation like [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com). Let's say that the
[Etsy](http://www.etsy.com) Seller Team wants to boost seller numbers in Brazil. Rather than having
a bunch of feature requirements handed over to that team, a good KPI would be that they want ½ a
million sellers in Brazil. It's then up to the team to go figure it out to reach that KPI. It is
up to the team to solve it (for instance, they should get on a plane to Brazil to embed themselves
with their customers).

## <a name="the-role-of-design"></a> 7. The Role of Design

Most companies just *don't* understand design. They think that it's look and feel. Or worse, that
it's just the UI: the buttons and the colours.

{% blockquote Steve Jobs %}
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
{% endblockquote %}

Design is a multi-disciplinary area, and companies need to realise that this comprises:

* User research, both qualitative and quantitative research
* Information Architecture
* User Experience
* UI Design
* Interaction Design
* and much more

A bad smell is that "design" is handled by Product Managers who still make wireframes (in absence of
any formal training) and then blindly hand this over to a graphic designer, who just pretties it up.
This creates a bad situation, and *undesirable* products. Our customers just end up with no desire
whatsoever to use our product.

## <a name="true-collaboration"></a> 8. True Collaboration

Marty feels there are 3 critical competencies to have in the product organisation:

**Engineers** - they need to participate in *what* to build, not just *how*. It's best to involve
*every* engineer in ideation (and the best teams do). At a bare minimum, the Lead Engineer should
be involved in ideation. Engineers should be participating in discovery and watching customers.
This should really be happening for 20 minutes a day minimum.

**Designers** - they're working on discovery and prototyping.

**Product Managers** - the Product Manager role is pretty unclear. They definitely need to
understand the customers deeply. They also need to have a deep knowledge of the data: how the
tool/app is actually being used. They need to be incorporating and analysing any number of different
types of analytics: data analytics, customer analytics, compute analytics (processing, etc).

The Product Manager should understand *each* of the stakeholders involved in your
product. A litmus test for defining a stakeholder is if that person could throw a wrench in the
works, then they're a stakeholder. What you're trying to understand here is not their requirements,
but the *constraints* that they operate under, eg. a Finance stakeholder cares about the cost and
money it takes, a Legal stakeholder operates under the constraint of law and regulation. You need to
convice those stakeholders that you understand them and that you will only propose solutions
within those constraints.

Some other important activities that the Product Manager should do is understand and be aware of
industry trends, and sourcing reference customers (sometimes harder than it sounds).

Overall, once you have the 3 critical competencies in your dedicated team, colocation makes
working together easier: then you're not in document sending hell.

## <a name="the-need-for-speed"></a> 9. The Need for Speed

{% pullquote %}
Look at your own product development process: if the workflow from `Roadmap` to `Deploy` takes
weeks, then you are super slow. {" You should be able to take on 5 significant ideas or approaches a
week"} *at least*. An analogy is baseball's number of [at bats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat).
{% endpullquote %}

A typical reaction for most companies (sadly too true) is just to pressure your engineers to do
more (or just some vague command to "Get faster!"). Don't do pressure your engineers. Speed really
comes form the techniques of evaluating things faster.

## <a name="product-culture"></a> 10. Product Culture

When talking about a Product Culture, Marty doesn't mean a company's culture. A lot of companies
have a great company culture but also have a horrible product culture that hasn't innovated for
years. Conversely, there are a number of companies with a great product culture that have a horrible
company culture. Marty didn't point fingers, but I think we have a few ideas.

A product culture really respects **data over opinions**. If your data proves something
different to your belief, then that's where you go. Admittedly, sometimes you will still do things
*in spite* of the data, but there have to be valid reasons and circumstances for why.

A product culture really represents true collaboration between product and engineering (sounds great,
doesn't it!). This culture means that we'd never release something without the measurements in place
so that we can learn from it. This environment pushes for rapidly testing and learning, and
consensus not dictatorship.

## <a name="q-and-a"></a> Questions & Answers

After wrapping his talk, Marty had some time for questions.

#### If you're just getting started and don't have customers (or you're in an industry with a limited or finite number of customers), how do you get reference customers to test against?

Marty reminded us that most of the time when we're experimenting with our ideas, we're actually
not trying to be statistically significant. For B2B environments, the process of sourcing customers
can be typically very hard. In both a B2B environment and a customer-focused environment, we're
aiming for a *qualitative* assessment. We've got to go face-to-face. One of Marty's friends had a
great quote along the lines that if you go face-to-face with a customer, you likely won't get all
the pieces from that session. But every face-to-face sessions gives you a bit more, until you get to
that headslap moment: "why didn't we see that before!" In a B2B environment, Marty uses the Customer
Development Program technique to help this along.

Essentially, we're trying to get to product/market fit and we're aiming to find 6 live reference
customers where we meet *all* their needs.

#### How do you execute so many tests?

One of Marty's friends, [Tom Chi](https://twitter.com/thegoodtomchi), running design at Google Glass
was running 15 iterations *a week* (which we all agreed was insane)! In an environment working on
both hardware and software like that, you have to get very creative. So they used things like clay
to work on hardware models, rather than build in plastic every time. Every prototype was a hack,
and they tried all sorts of ideas, like a [Minority Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/)
style interface. They had all sorts of tests for every aspect of the Glass: weight, size, shape.
But the key thing was that every prototype tested at least one idea.

So how does this actually play out?

For example, if you wanted to try out a new payment mechanism, you could build a Simulation
Prototype to put in front of users. Then you observe if the users are lost, or if we've missed
something. Once we have a version, then we build a Live Data Prototype.

#### How do you choose what ideas to fund?

If you have a new idea that you want to play out, and there is already a team in place with KPIs,
they might already be solving it. You could also expand the KPIs to deal with the new idea.

If it's a new thing (eg. Uber wants to move into pizza delivery), then you should spin up a new
dedicated team, but *just* the discovery team is funded, comprising a Product person, Designer and
a Lead Engineer.

#### How do you deal with companies that were innovating at one point and no longer are?

I asked this question around how companies that once were very innovative places degrade to places
that no longer innovate. For instance, startups that iterated like crazy at the start to get to
product/market fit as fast as they could, but then settle on a product and just scale it out.

Marty said that a lot of these kind of companies fall into the trap of believing the propaganda out
there: that it's a startup or you're scaling. But you can't stop innovating at any point: it's
right there in the title: "Continuous Innovation". You have to do more than the basic optimisations.

Some of this is really about educating the leadership of this. [Skunkworks projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project)
and [hackathons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) are great for this. I asked Marty if he
thought that going dark (where you basically stop communicating to allow the team to work in
isolation) was an effective strategy. Marty said to be careful here, if you go dark for too long,
then there are other problems that arise. Overall, Marty believes you can't wait for permission,
you've just got to do some stuff.

Marty recognised that there are different approaches for product discovery at a startup versus a more established company. One of the nice things about being a startup is that there's nothing to protect
in your tests: there's no brand, no revenue, no customers! Your only mission is to go find something
that gets traction. On the flip side, there's no money and it's a race to get to Product/Market Fit
before the cash that you do have runs out.

Once you do get to Product/Market Fit, you can't just stop the Discovery process now that we have
traffic and we have real customers. A lot of companies waste that traffic, and are just sitting
there waiting for a competitor to come along and disrupt them. Companies still need to be testing,
but in a way that protects brands, revenue, employees (there are techniques to do this in a safe
way that does protect these things).

Everyone should be doing A/B testing but you should *especially* be doing A/B tests for highly risky
stuff so that you're trying new ideas. Mostly, A/B tests are done blind, but sometimes you cam break
this rule and explicitly invite people into your test (like a beta). This will skew your numbers a
bit upwards (it'll skew left on the adoption curve) but you can get better information.

#### How do you do this discovery process with a remote team?

An example was posed of 37signals: they have been successful at product innovation with a fully
remote team (they even
[wrote a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804137501&linkCode=as2&tag=timhor0e-20&linkId=YYGKBX6WKRMJCCBZ)
about it!) - does this approach work with such a team? Marty countered with the explanation that
37signals is actually mostly designers, and they get to pick what they want to work on. So, a
pretty atypical organisation.

Marty told us it is *possible* to work remotely, but it's just not the *best* way. Sometimes you're
constrained and *have* to work remotely. For instance, [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) wanted the
best resources for their team *anywhere* in the world, so that meant having to work remotely.

In general, you want:

* **Plan A** - colocation
* **Plan B** - Product Manager, Designer and Lead Engineer are colocated together. Rest of Engineering team
  is remote. The Lead Engineer is the liason to the remote Engineering team.
* **Plan C** - Product Manager and Designer are colocated together. Engineering team is remote.

#### Where do ideas come from?

You very rarely find a company that doesn't have ideas. They're typically stored up in a backlog
somewhere. The hard part is the conversion of ideas from the backlog into the discovery process.

If you can do 5 ideas a week, then you can work through *a lot* of that backlog.

When it comes to assessing ideas that you do have, ask yourself:

* Does this idea take you in the direction of your [vision](#vision-and-passion)?
* Does this idea take you in the positive direction of your [KPIs](#outcome-over-output)?

If you answer yes to both of those questions, then an idea is promising.

Most of all, listen to your engineering team. They're closest to the technology (and are most aware
of new possibilities in other tech). But really, recognise that anyone is smart and will have ideas.
You should also watch your customers using your products.

Remember, our job is to quickly separate good from bad. If you can assess 20 ideas in a quarter,
then your goal should be to get to a 100 ideas in a quarter.

#### What does it take to do this?

You need to spend a lot of time ideating, prototyping and building.

We can use our backlog as a measurement tool:

* If the backlog is empty, then Product is failing to come up with new ideas
* If the backlog is weeks or months long, then Engineering is failing to build out ideas

Another way of viewing the Continuous Discovery model is as a Dual Track Agile approach. Every idea
on the backlog is fully baked (designed, validated and ready to go), so that Engineering can just
pick it up.

We're really looking to assess changes to throughput.

#### How do you balance between continuous discovery and continuous delivery?

A lot of optimisations are just the small, easy ones (like tweaking a colour for higher conversions).
Just pump these ones out.

What should we be focusing on instead? Validating the high risk ones. You should use your judgement
based on your KPIs for the best things to do.

The reality is that it will depend on the team and that point in time. For some teams, the right
thing to do based on the data will be just to do more small optimisations, or focus on bug fixes.
For other teams, the data might say that Engineering is slowing down (it just takes too long to
build things), so the focus should be on eliminating technical debt.

#### How do I find time for this process with all the meetings I have to do?

After the laughter from this question settled down, Marty set out how the people on the teams should
be allocating their time:

* PMs/Designers should typically spend all day in Discovery, with 1 hour a day set aside for working
  with Engineers in Delivery.
* Engineering should spend all day in Delivery (development, test automation, deployments), with
  1 hour a day set aside for working on Discovery.

The exception to this is where a prototype requirements development, eg. a Live Data Prototype. In
Scrum, this would be a "spike".

Marty closed his talk by reminding us of two big points:

It's *very* important to keep iterating (multiple times).

Never consider a discovery phase a failure, it's just what you learnt (a saying from Tom Chi).
