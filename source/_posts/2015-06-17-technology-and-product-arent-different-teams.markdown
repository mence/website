It's common for companies to have a technology or engineering team.

It's also unfortunately common for the same company to have a separate product team.

Even more messed up companies have a separate design team.

This is usually a symptom of following the IT Services model. In which people are actually resources,
not creatives who need to come together with a unique set of skills to do awesome things.

In the IT Services model, you find an problem: "Our designs suck and we need better design!". So you
make a design team, hire some designers, put them all together somewhere, and they pump out
Photoshop design (or Keynotes, shudder) that they hand over to the engineering team.

Alice says, "Hey, what's going on with our site traffic?", so you make an analytics team, hire some
analysts, put them all together somewhere, and they start pumping out reports that they email to the
company.

Brenda says, "Hey, how did we do last month?", so you make a reporting team, hire some reporting
people, put them all together somewhere, and they start pumping out reports and visualisations that
they give to their boss.

Begin to see the pattern?

Imagine you knew a bunch of musicians who all play different instruments or have different styles.
Would you mix them around or would you split them up by speciality? You *could* put all the guitars
in one band, all the drummers in another band, all the singers in yet another band, and so on. For
some of the bands that might *really* work: you end up with a beautiful guitar rock group that just
jams, or an acapella quartet.

But damn, you're probably going to have some really, really, *really* terrible bands too.

The smarter approach would be to build multi-disciplinary bands that can switch and change as they
grow: a band with a singer, a guitarist, a drummer, a sax, a DJ and a bass. Maybe that's too much
for that group. Maybe it should just be a singer and a guitarist. Or perhaps they love that big
sound and they need more instruments.

To bring it back down to earth, every team that I've come across that has a separate product and
technology team has eventually struggled to get to the next level. The inevitable conflict between
what the Product team wants to do and what the Technology team *can* do or *wants* to do begins to
chafe. Eventually as business needs push the product managers more and more, the PMs work longer and
longer hours and just begin to try to just 'solve' all the possible problems. Eventually they end up
just presenting a list of things to Engineering to "just build". The engineers get sick of just
being given a list of prescribed things to build and flip the table.

That's a great way to have a bunch of engineers (because you haven't given them anything real to
work on for months) and PMs (because they're so, so tired) quit.

Can you afford to lose your entire product and development team?

So here's Tim's 5 step program for fixing your product development problems:

1. Stop trying to just build more stuff
2. Combine your product and engineering teams, and nominate someone to lead the new combined team
   (ideally a product minded CTO, or a technical CPO. Someone who's built and shipped products
   before.)
3. Separate everyone into two-pizza sized multi-disciplinary product-focused teams
4. Give each team valuable goals to achieve <small>*[1]*</small>
5. Get the hell out of their way <small>*[2]*</small>

Let's stop the Product/Engineering separation.

<small>
  *[1] A valuable goal is something that actually builds your business in a tangible, real way.
  Don't use vanity metrics here (traffic, market share, etc). A real metric is something that will
  actually change your business - time to solve, engagement, conversions, LTV, etc. If more eyeballs
  doesn't make your product better, or your customers lives better, then it's not a real metric.*

  *[2] Your job now is to shield the teams and give them everything they want - private offices,
  snacks, better monitors, quiet space, noise-cancelling headphones, whatever. You're seriously
  quibbling over buying a bunch of snacks when they're building your billion dollar business?*
