There are a lot of people in technology, particularly startups, who think they're really smart.
Super smart.

Some of them *are*.

But the really, *really* smart ones, the ones I'll always have time for, are the ones who don't
think they're the smartest person in the room.

They know that's there is always more to learn from others. There's always something they didn't
understand. There's always an assumption that should be challenged.

Those are the people that you want to make your employees, your network and your friends.

Because you'll never stop learning with them, and they'll never stop learning from you.

Don't think that you know it all. Don't be afraid to start over. Don't be afraid to be challenged
by others. Start from a position of humility and then learn. Don't assume you know everything.

Don't assume you're the smartest person in the room.
