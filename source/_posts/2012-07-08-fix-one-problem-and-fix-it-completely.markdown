Marco Arment remarked on [this post from Matt Buchanan](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbuchanan/it-never-gets-better) complaining on the futility of updates that:

{% blockquote %}
Nothing has changed: the products that were great on day one are still great, and the ones that weren’t still aren’t.
{% endblockquote %}

The consistent message I hear about how to do product development right is that the lesson that Apple learnt, and tries to impart upon it's developers, is **fix one problem, and fix it completely**. Future updates are to solve future problems, not to fix the thing you tried to fix before.

If you can't solve the problem with a software update, you solve it with a hardware update. But when you fix the problem that your customers are having (whatever problem it may be - they may not even know they have the problem yet), fix it ﻿*totally*.﻿ Don't release something that's half-baked.

Marco sums it up well in his [previous post](http://www.marco.org/2010/07/04/great-since-day-one) that he calls out again:

{% blockquote %}
In brief, their philosophy seems to be to ship only what’s great and leave out the rest. That’s why, instead of having a bad copy-and-paste implementation for the iPhone’s first two years, we just didn’t have one at all.
{% endblockquote %}

There is a danger for product teams who have successfully adopted [continuous delivery](http://continuousdelivery.com/), or maybe are trying out Eric Ries' [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) ideas, to release something that doesn't work the first time because it's technically easy to. 'It's okay, we can solve it later' is a good way to under-deliver to your customers. Trial your idea extensively first, work out the kinks, *then* ship the thing that **works**.
