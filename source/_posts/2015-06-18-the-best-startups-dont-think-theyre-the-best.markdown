It's easy for startups to fall into the trap of believing their own hype. As
[Marty Cagan put it](http://timhordern.com/marty-cagan-continuous-innovation-how-to-create-products-customers-love/),
"It's easy to start believing your own bullshit".

There are so many larger companies that have stopped working hard, innovating, searching for what
their customers actually wanted because they became #1.

They didn't have to work for anything any more:

* they're getting the traffic, so why bother updating the website?
* they're getting the revenue, so why bother building new products?
* they've got the users already, so why bother finding why they're using our product?
* they believe their existing userbase won't leave them
* they believe their users will just use their new non-validated product "because we're #1"
* they believe they can spend a bunch of time working on long-running projects because their users
  will still be there at the end
* they shake off bad reviews because they've got so many other users

Notice the trend? These companies stopped listening to their users and building what their users
cared about. They **started believing their own bullshit**.

The world is littered with the remnants of companies and teams that fell into the trap of
listening to their own marketing. Don't think you're the best. Think you're second best and you've
got to keep working harder.
