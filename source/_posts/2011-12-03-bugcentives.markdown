If you measure testers by the amount of bugs that they find, it's amazing how quickly you will see your testers find a whole lot of bugs. Whether you fine people for not finding bugs or reward people for finding them, testers are smart - they'll find you bugs to report. After all, you just incentivised finding bugs.

The sheer number of bug reports isn't a measure of quality. It's a chart. Don't mistake the two.

Bugs are good things to find. Encourage your testers to find them. But don't make it a performance measure.
