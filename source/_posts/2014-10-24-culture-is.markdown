*[1] This idea is described in Australia to a certain extent as [mateship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateship)
of an inclusive nature. It is a term that has militaristic connotations as well for Australians, as
the [ANZAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps) story often revolves
around thinking not necessarily of fighting for the broader goals (the war), or even the tactical
goals (the battle) but fighting because your mates depend on you. In this context, teams that feel
bonded and work for each other not individuals (selflessness not selfishness) builds mateship.*

*[2] Arguably you might even want to consider even longer than that because allowing people to
solve problems that are more complete than a random hack. Also, this means that you could consider
doing multiple hacks, or a non-work hack and a work hack.*
