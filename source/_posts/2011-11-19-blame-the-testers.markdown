[Yes, you should just blame the testers for all the problems.](http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/security-it/security-breaches-the-result-of-sloppy-testing-20111109-1n6po.html)

Don't blame the rushed project management.

Don't blame the lack of budgets.

Don't blame the companies unwilling to train their testers in actually being testers.

Don't blame the industry standards where testing is an afterthought to rushed development.

Don't blame the poor quality development cycle that prioritises development and releasing over releasing a tested product.

Don't blame the waterfall development process used where testing is the last, smallest, rushed piece of a development cycle running behind schedule.

Don't blame the project managers who ask for 100 page strategy documents from testers instead of letting the testers test.

Don't blame the consultancies who offshore their work to untrained staff rather than hiring and training experienced local staff because they underbid the project so badly that there would be no way they could afford to pay for good testing experts.

Don't blame the IT managers who don't want defects because defects cut into their bonuses.

Don't blame the IT managers who don't understand IT and haven't ever worked in a technical capacity.

Don't blame the enterprise architects who coordinate such a confusing architecture that no-one has a complete picture of how the thing works, let alone finding holes in that architecture.

Don't blame the software vendors who buid a system so complex that no single person understands it all.

Don't blame the software vendors who charge a ~~small~~ huge fortune for these systems but don't spend the money on improving the software and only worry about improving their shareprice.

Don't blame the business who ask for projects yesterday for as little money as possible.

Don't blame the cowboy attitude that lets people have complete access to making changes in production.

Don't blame the industry that encourage the attitude of developers sending untested code to production.

Don't blame a company which spends hundreds of millions of dollars on bankers but refuses to pay their IT staff a real salary.

Don't blame a company that ignores their staff when they tell them that they need more time before they release their product.

Don't blame the software vendors who believe 3 days of presentations represents a complete system audit.

Don't blame the company that staffs its projects with more overhead staff like project managers, administrators, project management office staff and managers than technical people.

Don't blame the company who pays for 1 manager instead of 3 testers.

Don't blame the project culture which encourages staff to switch from company to company for higher and higher rates.

Don't blame the near-enough-is-good-enough culture.

Don't blame the IT lecturers who blame testers for IT problems without understanding the root cause of the problems.

Don't blame the IT lecturers who only teach programming and treat testing as an afterthought.

Don't blame the IT lecturers who don't teach that testing is important and that code quality is everyone's responsibility.

Don't blame the IT lecturers who don't inspire students to value quality.

Don't blame the IT students who avoid testing because their lecturers told them testing was bad/boring/not required/useless.

Don't blame the IT recruiters who don't know what differentiates a good tester from a bad tester.

Don't blame the industry which has an incredible shortage of testers leading to testers being overworked past breaking point. 

But yeah, it's the testers fault.

This isn't the fault of the testers. This was the fault of everyone.

If you blame the testers, you don't understand quality. Quality is everyone's responsibility and everyone's problem. 

But that's a ~~much better story~~ much harder article to write than just writing that testing sucks.
